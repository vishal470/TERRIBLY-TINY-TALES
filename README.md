# TERRIBLY TINY TALES Assignment

## Overview

Hello Sir,

I am Vishal Sharma, the developer of this assignment using React Js. The project utilizes several libraries and plugins to enhance functionality, including Axios, Concurrently, and Json Server.

## Project Explanation

### Src Folder Structure

The `Src` folder is organized with a `Component` folder, containing various sub-folders. Additionally, a `db.json` file is located in the `Src` folder, where all the data displayed on the page is stored. Axios is used for fetching this data.

### Component's Files Explanation

1. **Navbar:**
   - Displays the navigation bar.

2. **Hero:**
   - Presents the background image and CEO image.

3. **Bio:**
   - Showcases CEO details such as name, followers, and other relevant information.

4. **Summary:**
   - Displays posts and other related details.

5. **Match:**
   - Description of the Match component

6. **Build:**
   - Description of the Build component

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal.

2. Run the command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command starts both the `db.json` server and the React App on different ports.

3. Alternatively, you can start only the React App with:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Note: If the `db.json` server is not running on a different port, the app will display 'Loading...'.

**Hosting Information:**
I have hosted this project on Vercel. You can access the deployed version by [clicking here](https://terribly-tiny-tales-2dkj.vercel.app/). Please note that you need to run the `db.json` file on a server using the following command:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
```

I am in the process of learning how to host the db.json file separately and plan to improve my skills in this area.

Lastly, I want to express my joy in completing this project. It has been a valuable learning experience, and I have gained a lot from it.

Best regards,
Vishal Sharma
